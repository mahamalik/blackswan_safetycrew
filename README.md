# blackswan_safetycrew
DAEN 690 Project Repo

This is where the information for Black Swan Safety Crew's will go
I have organized it into multiple folders.
- Data will contain the data either simulated or collected
- Documents will contain the documents relevant to the project, either academic research papers, online warticles etc.
- Scripts will contain current scripts that are used for testing and analysis.
- Test will contain deprecated scripts that are no longer being used as well as an explanation either in the code or the readme.md for why the script was abandoned for use.

8-30-2022: The Github has been set up and the team is at work currently deciding how to tackle this problem, and the best methods and packages to use.
